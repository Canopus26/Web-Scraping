Wade, the landmark decision that legalised abortion nationwide. The remarks, which are scheduled for 12.30 pm, will outline his approach to this new phase of the fight over abortion access. The White House has been preparing for this moment since a draft of the decision leaked in May. Officials have been huddling with state leaders, advocates, health care professionals and others to prepare for a future without Roe v. Wade. Now Biden's plans will be tested in terms of politics and policy. Outside the Supreme Court, a crowd of abortion supporters swelled to the hundreds after the ruling was issued. One chanted into a bullhorn, “legal abortion on demand” and “this decision must not stand.” A competing faction demonstrated in favour of the ruling, holding signs saying ''the future is anti-abortion? and “dismember Roe.” Biden and other Democrats hope to use outrage over the court decision to rally voters in November's midterm elections. Although nationwide legislation ensuring access to abortion appears out of reach, more Democratic victories at the state level could limit Republican efforts to ban the practice. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the ruling “is outrageous and heart-wrenching” and fulfills the Republican Party's ''dark and extreme goal of ripping away women's right to make their own reproductive health decisions.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters that he applauds the court decision. “A lot of lives are going to be saved,” McCarthy told reporters. “But it also goes back to people in the states to have a say in the process.” Many Republican-controlled states are poised to severely restrict abortion, or even ban it outright. The White House has been exploring options for Biden to take executive action to safeguard abortion rights, but his options are limited. Lawrence Gostin, who runs the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health at Georgetown Law, said ahead of Friday's ruling that he expected the Biden administration to be “to be nibbling around the edges, and is not going to do anything really profound.” Gostin said he's discussed a variety of options with administration officials but believes they are “gun shy” given the potential for legal challenges that could lead to more roadblocks from a US Supreme Court that's currently dominated by conservatives. Some of Gostin's suggestions included having Medicaid cover the cost of travelling across state lines to end pregnancies, as well as expanding access to abortion medication that can be delivered by mail. “States couldn't pick and choose what cancer drug they would allow, and they shouldn't be permitted to choose what options women have for medication abortions that are fully approved as safe and effective,” he said. Alexandra LaManna, a White House spokeswoman, said earlier this week that the president “believes we should defend the right of all Americans to make their own decisions'', and she added that Republican policies “include abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest, and criminalising women who have an abortion and the physicians who perform them.” During their preparations, White House officials have held a series of meetings with advocates, medical groups and faith leaders who are supportive of abortion access. The Rev. John Dorhauer, the general minister and president of the United Church of Christ, drove from Cleveland to Washington, DC, to attend one meeting earlier this month. Another virtual meeting held this week, featuring Vice President Kamala Harris. “It was rather impressive to see the commitment the White House and the vice president's office has had to gather advocates from around the country,” Dorhauer said. However, there are also concerns that the administration is not ready. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, attended a recent virtual meeting with abortion providers and said she expects “a true health crisis”. “I think that we should have been preparing for far longer than we have been,” McNicholas said. “Do I think that they recognize that this a problem? Yes. Do I think that they're prepared in this moment? No.” \\n\\xa0 Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

The seven firms have collectively applied for a cumulative capacity of 70 Giga Watt hours (GWh) of ACC batteries against the proposal invited for 10 GWh with a maximum budgetary outlay of Rs 3,620 crore. The list of bidders who have submitted bids in response to this tender are ACME Cleantech Solutions Private Limited, Amara Raja Advanced Cell Technologies Private Limited, Anvi Power Industries Private Limited, JSW Neo Energy Limited, Reliance Industries Limited, Lucas TVS Limited, and Waaree Energies Limited for a cumulative capacity of 70 GWh, the Ministry of Heavy Industries said in a statement. In 2022, the government awarded PLI support to establish 30 GWh of ACC battery manufacturing capacity by 2030. Out of this Ola Cell Technologies secured the majority share with a 20 GWh capacity. ACC Energy Storage (bid as Rajesh Exports) and Reliance New Energy Battery Storage were granted PLI incentives for 5 GWh each. The PLI scheme for manufacturing of ACC batteries was approved by the union cabinet in May 2021. Total incentive outlay under the scheme has been pegged at Rs 18,100 crore for achieving manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh of ACC. ACC refers to high-capacity and high-efficiency electrochemical energy storage cells used in various applications, primarily where battery storage is crucial.

The two young businesses in the conglomerate--- Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) and Jio Platforms Ltd (JPL)--- registered profits of ₹11,101 crore (up 20.9%) and ₹21,423 crore (up 12%), respectively. The standalone profit of RIL, which houses the mainstay oil refining and petrochemicals businesses, stood at ₹42,042 crore, compared to ₹44,190 crore in the previous year.  What next is the question now. The group’s consolidated net debt stood at ₹1.16 lakh crore despite its 5G rollout that cost ₹2 lakh crore and massive retail and FMCG expansions. The exploration and production investments in KG Basin are also over. It still has a cash and cash equivalent of ₹2.08 lakh crore on books. Considering the current cash flow, the company will be able to repay its entire net debt portion with its profit of one and a half years. It has only one major investment pending at present--- the five giga factories for solar panels and storage battery manufacturing. The earmarked investment for the project is ₹75,000 crore. The investors expect a demerger now with IPOs of Jio and retail businesses as it would fetch better valuations for the businesses. Both the businesses are led by two separate teams under the chairman Mukesh Ambai’s children Isha and Akash. The businesses have reached the size to generate cash flows to meet capex and manage the debt. RIL is valued at ₹20 lakh crore in the stock market at a price to equity of 44.83. Mukesh Ambani said in the FY24 result statement that the initiatives across RIL’s businesses have made a remarkable contribution towards fostering growth of various sectors of the Indian economy. He added that RIL became the first Indian company to cross the ₹1 lakh crore threshold in pre-tax profits. The digital services business has been boosted by accelerated expansion of subscriber base, supported by both mobility and fixed wireless services. It has over 108 million 5G customers. Reliance Retail, which started opening stores aggressively since 2016, has 18,836 stores across the country. It has also started its new FMCG business with acquisition of brands and launch of new ones.

Revenue from operations increased by 11% year-on-year to Rs 2.4 lakh crore in the reporting period, up from Rs 2.16 lakh crore in the previous year\\'s quarter. While the company\\'s net profit fell, it is better than what analysts had predicted. The company\\'s operating profit (EBITDA) showed growth, increasing by 14% year-on-year to Rs 47,150 crore in the March quarter. Additionally, margins expanded by 50 basis points to 17.8%. The board has approved a second dividend of Rs 10 per share for the financial year 2024. In the previous fiscal year, it had already distributed a dividend of Rs 9 per share.  Compared to the previous quarter, the bottom line surged by 10%, and revenue went up by 6%. In a filing with the stock exchange, RIL stated that gross revenue increased by 17.8% to Rs 76,627 crore, marking a 10.6% rise from the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by gains in consumer electronics and fashion & lifestyle sectors. \"Initiatives across RIL’s businesses have made a remarkable contribution towards fostering growth of various sectors of the Indian economy. It is heartening to note that alongside strengthening the national economy, all segments have posted a robust financial and operating performance. This has helped the Company achieve multiple milestones,\" said Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited, Mukesh Ambani, commenting on the results.  The increase in revenue was backed by double-digit growth in O2C (oil-to-chemicals) and consumer businesses. \"Strong demand for fuels globally, and limited flexibility in refining system worldwide, supported margins and profitability of the O2C segment,\" said Ambani regarding the O2C segment.  Jio\\'s average revenue per user (ARPU) stood at Rs 181.7, benefiting from an improved subscriber mix. However, this was partly offset by a rising proportion of promotional 5G traffic, which is offered unlimited to subscribers and not yet billed separately.Published By: Sonu VivekPublished On: Apr 22, 2024'}\n"
